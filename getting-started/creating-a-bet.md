# Creating a Bet

To create a bet for other users, you need to navigate to your own Dashboard and click the “Create Bet”-Button. You are required to choose a description and optional 2 outcomes if it is not a YES/NO bet. You also need to set the percentage of the share you will receive through this bet.
