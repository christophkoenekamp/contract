# Create your Wallet

After launching the application for the first time, you will be required to choose a 8 digit PIN and generate a new Ethereum wallet or import an existing one per Mnemonic words. The wallet generation process will give you 12 Mnemonic words that are needed to access your Ethereum wallet and should be written down. If the wallet file is deleted and the words are lost, the funds on the wallet can not be restored! On each login after creating or importing a wallet, you are only required to type in your chosen PIN to login.
