# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is open access to digital money and data-friendly services for everyone â€“ no matter your background or location. It's a community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency Ether \(ETH\) and thousands of applications you can use today - like Nerve.

A technology that lets you send cryptocurrency to anyone for a small fee. It also powers applications that everyone can use and no one can take down.

#### Banking for everyone

Not everyone has access to financial services. But all you need to access Ethereum and its lending, borrowing and savings products is an internet connection and a wallet.

#### A more private internet

You don't need to provide all your personal details to use an Ethereum app. Ethereum is building an economy based on value, not surveillance.

#### A peer-to-peer network

Ethereum allows you to move money, or make agreements, directly with someone else. You don't need to go through intermediary companies.

#### Censorship-resistant

No government or company has control over Ethereum. This decentralization makes it nearly impossible for anyone to stop you from receiving payments or using services on Ethereum.
